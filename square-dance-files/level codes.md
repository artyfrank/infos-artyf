# basics:
the codes you get from clicking the share button in the level editor  
## the first letter  
this is any letter between a-j and tells square-dance the width of the level, which is how far into the alphabet it is
```e.g a = 1 b = 2 d = 4 f = 6 j = 10 i = 11```
the rest of the code must have a length longer than how far into the alphabet the first letter is or if the first letter is "a"
must be longer than 2  
## the rest of the code
any capital letter excluding "R" and "S" (enough to add portals)  
A =   
B =   
C =   
D =   
E =   
F =   
G =   
H =   
I =   
J =   
K =   
L =   
M =   
N =   
O =   
P =   
Q =   
T =   
U =   
V =   
W =   
X =   
Y =   
Z =
